Social deficits and physiological ageing

This project uses data from ELSA https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=200011#!/abstract

Users need to request permission to access ELSA and then create a harmonised dataset using the file entitled "CREATION OF ELSA HARMONISED DATASET"

The code from the file entitled "Social deificts biological ageing v13_submitted" can then be run

Users require Stata v18. The file has only been tested on v17 and v18. Stata can be downloaded here https://www.stata.com/ and takes approximately 5 minutes to install.

The run time for the code is under 10 minutes in total. The code contains embedded reproduction instructions.
